GreenSystems is a project taken on by friends since Secondary School where we provide an online marketplace where the everyday individual can list produce they wish to
sell and provide a client to client service. The system also provides a feature where many sellers can sell to one individual through the use of an optimization tool 
known as MiniZinc. Minizinc would allow a buyer to specify what products they wish to buy as well as the quantity and would provide a list of queries with either the 
lowest price to fill that order or the least amount of distance between the buyer and the seller.
